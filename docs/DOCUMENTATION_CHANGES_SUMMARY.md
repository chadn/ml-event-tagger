-   ✅ Phase 3: Preprocessing Pipeline (2-3 hours)
-   ✅ Phase 4: Model Training (3-4 hours)
-   ✅ Phase 5: API Service (2-3 hours)
-   ✅ Phase 6: Testing & Validation (1-2 hours)
-   ✅ Phase 7: Docker & Deployment (1-2 hours)
-   ✅ Phase 8: Documentation Polish (2-3 hours)

Each phase includes:

-   Clear goal
-   Detailed task checklist
-   Code examples
-   Success criteria
-   Time estimate

**Additional sections:**

-   Definition of Done checklist
