# üè∑Ô∏è Tag Taxonomy & Labeling Guide

This document defines the tag vocabulary for the ml-event-tagger MVP and provides guidelines for consistent labeling.

**Version:** 1.0
**Last updated:** October 17, 2025

---

## üéØ Purpose

A controlled vocabulary of 15-20 tags covering common event characteristics in the Oakland/Bay Area event scene (primarily from CMF data).

**Key principles:**

-   **Simple:** Easy to apply consistently
-   **Practical:** Based on actual events
-   **Multi-label:** Events can have multiple tags (2-5 typical)
-   **Demonstrative:** For MVP, not production-perfect taxonomy

---

## üìù Labeling Guidelines

### How Many Tags?

-   **Minimum:** 1 tag (rare)
-   **Typical:** 2-5 tags
-   **Maximum:** 7 tags (avoid over-tagging)

**Examples:**

-   "Days Like This - House Music" ‚Üí [`music`, `house`, `dj`, `dance`, `outdoor`, `weekly`] (6 tags ‚úÖ)
-   "Jazz Festival" ‚Üí [`music`, `jazz`, `band`, `outdoor`] (4 tags ‚úÖ)
-   "Food Vendors" ‚Üí [`food`, `outdoor`, `public`] (3 tags ‚úÖ)

### Tag Selection Process

1. **Read name, description, and location** fully
2. **Identify primary category** (music/activity type)
3. **Add genre/specific activity** if applicable
4. **Add location** (oakland/sf/berkeley)
5. **Add characteristics** (outdoor/weekly/etc.) if clear
6. **Review:** Do 2-5 tags capture the essence? ‚úÖ

### Edge Cases

**Music event with unclear genre:**

-   Use `music` only, skip genre-specific tag
-   E.g., "Live music night" ‚Üí [`music`, `oakland`]

**Event in multiple categories:**

-   Use both! E.g., "Yoga + Live Music" ‚Üí [`yoga`, `music`]

**Recurring events:**

-   Only add `weekly` if explicitly stated or clearly recurring
-   Not needed for "Days Like This" mentions (already known to be weekly)

**Location unclear:**

-   If address is missing or unclear, skip location tag
-   Don't guess

**Family-friendly:**

-   Only add `family` if explicitly mentioned or all-ages
-   Don't assume

## ‚öñÔ∏è Quality Control

### Before Finalizing Labels

Ask yourself:

1. ‚úÖ **Are the tags accurate?** Double-check against event details
2. ‚úÖ **Did I use 2-5 tags?** Not too few, not too many
3. ‚úÖ **Is the primary category covered?** (music/activity)
4. ‚úÖ **Is location included if known?** (oakland/sf/berkeley)
5. ‚úÖ **Are characteristics appropriate?** (outdoor/weekly/community/family)
6. ‚úÖ **Would someone else agree?** Consistency matters

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

‚ùå **Over-tagging:** Don't add every possible tag

-   Bad: [`music`, `house`, `techno`, `dance`, `dj`, `band`, `outdoor`, `indoor`, `weekly`, `community`] (10 tags)
-   Good: [`music`, `house`, `dj`, `outdoor`, `weekly`] (5 tags)

‚ùå **Under-tagging:** Don't be too minimal

-   Bad: [`music`] (only 1 tag)
-   Good: [`music`, `house`, `oakland`] (3 tags)

‚ùå **Guessing location:** Don't add location tags if unclear

-   If address is empty or vague, skip location tag

‚ùå **Inconsistent genre use:** Always use `music` + genre + performer type if applicable

-   Bad: [`house`] (missing music tag)
-   Good: [`music`, `house`, `dj`] (complete tags)

## üîÑ Tag Evolution

### MVP (v0.1)

-   21 tags total
-   Music-heavy (reflects CMF data from Oakland/Bay Area)
-   Added venue/access characteristics (outdoor, indoor, public, private, free)
-   Removed city-specific tags (Oakland, SF, Berkeley) - location info already in `location` field

### Future (v0.2+)

-   May add more genres (electronic, hip-hop, folk, etc.)
-   May add more activities (sports, networking, education)
-   May add more locations (other Bay Area cities)
-   May split some tags (e.g., `electronic` parent of `house`/`techno`)

### Requesting New Tags

If you encounter events that don't fit well:

1. Note the event details
2. Propose new tag with definition
3. Provide 3+ examples
4. Review with maintainer

---

## üìä Expected Tag Distribution

Based on CMF event data, expected tag frequency:

**High frequency (30%+ of events):**

-   `music`, `outdoor`, `public`

**Medium frequency (10-30%):**

-   `house`, `dance`, `dj`, `weekly`, `free`

**Low frequency (5-10%):**

-   `techno`, `jazz`, `community`, `band`, `indoor`

**Rare (<5%):**

-   `breaks`, `rock`, `punk`, `hiphop`, `yoga`, `art`, `food`, `private`

**Note:** This distribution will affect model performance. Rare tags will be harder to predict accurately.

---

## üß© Tools & Workflow

### Recommended Labeling Workflow

1. Open `data/events-raw-fb.json` (reference data)
2. Create/edit `data/labeled_events.json`
3. For each event:
    - Read all fields carefully
    - Apply tags following guidelines
    - Add event to labeled dataset
4. Periodically check tag distribution
5. Ensure minimum 5 examples per tag

### Validation Checklist

After labeling batch of events:

```python
import json
from collections import Counter

# Load labeled events
with open('data/labeled_events.json') as f:
    events = json.load(f)

# Check counts
print(f"Total events: {len(events)}")

# Tag distribution
all_tags = [tag for event in events for tag in event['tags']]
print("\nTag distribution:")
for tag, count in Counter(all_tags).most_common():
    print(f"  {tag}: {count}")

# Average tags per event
avg_tags = len(all_tags) / len(events)
print(f"\nAverage tags per event: {avg_tags:.1f}")
```

**Healthy ranges:**

-   Average tags per event: 2.5-4.5
-   No tag with <5 occurrences
-   No tag with >70% occurrence
